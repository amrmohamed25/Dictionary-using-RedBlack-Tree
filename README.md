following functionalities:

file, “dictionary.txt", containing a list of words. Each 
word will be in a separate line. - You should load the

“ERROR: Word already in the dictionary!"). 
4- Look-up a Word: - Takes a word from the user and 
prints “YES" or “NO" according to whether it is 
found or not.
